title: Fixed - Users being unexpectedly taken back to the landing page
---

A number of users reported experiencing that when they tried to interact with a page in new Bichard they were redirected back to the landing page that they see after logging in. After investigating with some users, we found that this was due to an issue with how the page was loading on slower internet connections. We have mitigated this issue so now you will no longer be kicked back to the landing page.

What you may now see when accessing new Bichard on a slow internet connection is a loading spinner. We anticipate that the majority of users won’t see this as the connections that you’re accessing Bichard are relatively fast. We are also looking into further technical work to improve the loading speed of Bichard.
