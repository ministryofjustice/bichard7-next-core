## ServiceNow

By clicking on the "contact support" links mentioned above, you are now directed to the MoJ instance of ServiceNow where you can raise support tickets relating to Bichard. The URL for this is [https://mojprod.service-now.com/](https://mojprod.service-now.com/)

Once here, for first-time login to ServiceNow, you need to click on the "Forgot your login details? Reset them" link which appears just below the login box.

Now, enter your Bichard email address, the same one which you use to login to Bichard itself. You will then be sent an email asking you to set a password, which once set, will enable you to use ServiceNow to raise tickets to the support team.
