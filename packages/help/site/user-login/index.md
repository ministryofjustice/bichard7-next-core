We have introduced a form of MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) to the Bichard login process, making it more secure but also easier for you to self-manage your Bichard accounts. This is detailed in the sections below:

- [Logging in to Bichard](logging-in-to-bichard/)
- [Resetting your password](resetting-password/)
- [Changing your password](changing-your-password/)
- [Setting up your account](new-account-setup/)
