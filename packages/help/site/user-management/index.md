If you have the User Manager role set against your account in Bichard, you can now manage your own team within the application. This allows you to view, edit, create and delete team members from within your allocated Force (removing the need to contact support to request this).

*Please note, this section is only applicable to users who are assigned the "User Manager" role in Bichard, other roles will not see these options/screens.*

* [Viewing details of users in your Force](viewing-users/)
* [Editing the details of a user](editing-users/)
* [Creating a new user](creating-users/)
* [Removing a user](removing-users/)
