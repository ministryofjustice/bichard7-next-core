# Automatic Login Attempt Script

This is a short puppeteer script that gets the email addresses of all supervisor users in the Bichard database, and for each one:

1. Visits the user-service login page
1. Enters their email address into the input box
1. Clicks the 'Sign In' button, thus triggering a CJSM email to be sent to the user

This allows us to test whether users can receive the CJSM verification emails from Bichard on a large scale.

## Running

To run the script, you can use `npm start`:

```shell
$ LOGIN_URL="http://localhost:3000/users/login" npm start
```

## Environment variables

The script uses the following environment variables for configuration:
