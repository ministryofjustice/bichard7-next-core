We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)."},{"href":"../decisions/2/","type":"Workspace Decision","title":"Use Data Transfer Objects","text":"Use Data Transfer Objects Status Context Consequences Date: 2023-09-22 Accepted Using a Data Transfer Object (DTO) in the `bichard-next-ui` repo will help separate the User Interface (React) from\nthe Database objects. It will also allow to use TypeScript more effectively, enforcing stricter types on objects at\ncompile time. We have chosen the naming convention of: A DTO object is a new object mirror with some of a Entity's attributes. We are actively using `Pick<T, \"field\">` to\nselect what we want to use out of the Entity and mapping via a function (e.g.\n`const displayObj = objToDisplayObjDto(obj)`). We can control the levels of data we want share. E.g. `displayPartialObj` or `displayFullObj`."},{"href":"../decisions/3/","type":"Workspace Decision","title":"Use Styled Components","text":"Use Styled Components Status Context File structure Consequences Date: 2024-04-12 Accepted We are currently using two different styling libraries (3 if you include `scss` files). We want to reduce the need to\nknow how to use the libraries and simplify the code base. We have opted to choose [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) over\n[React-JSS](https://cssinjs.org/react-jss/?v=v10.10.0) The negatives for `react-jss` are it is less flexible with `React`. E.g. you can pass `props` to `styled-components`\nfor separate themes. It can also pollute other `components` as it based on class names rather than `components`. We have opted to take the following approach to structuring the files: That allows to separate the styles from the `component` and keep close by. We can import other JS/TS files if needed,\ne.g. colours. We should also export all the Styled Components at bottom of the file, e.g."},{"href":"../decisions/4/","type":"Workspace Decision","title":"ESLint rule for newline after control flow blocks","text":"ESLint rule for newline after control flow blocks Status Context Consequences Date: 2024-05-23 Accepted This Pull Request introduces a new ESLint rule that enforces the addition of a newline after control flow blocks (e.g., `if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`). This rule aims to maintain consistent code formatting and enhance code readability across our codebase. We have been following the convention of adding newlines after control flow blocks to improve code readability and formatting. However, this practice has been manually enforced, leading to potential inconsistencies. By introducing this ESLint rule, we can ensure that the linter automatically checks for this convention, streamlining the process and promoting a consistent coding style."},{"href":"../decisions/5/","type":"Workspace Decision","title":"Using External Libraries","text":"Using External Libraries Status Context Decision Consequences Date: 2024-06-25 Accepted To ensure rapid delivery without reinventing the wheel, we will utilize external libraries and leverage existing solutions for complex problems. While these libraries provide substantial benefits, it's essential to establish guidelines to ensure a shared understanding of when to use external libraries and when to avoid them. Transitive dependencies can introduce underlying security vulnerabilities, increase the risk of dependency conflicts, and complicate the upgrade and maintenance processes."},{"href":"../decisions/6/","type":"Workspace Decision","title":"Use [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) API framework","text":"Use [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) API framework Status Context Decision Consequences Date: 2024-09-13 Pending As a team who are significantly invested in both [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for type safety both in development and at runtime, choosing technologies that provide first class support for these tools provides numerous benefits to the team: Our current web framework for the API is [Express](https://expressjs.com/). [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a well supported, widely used framework that can be effectively used to build APIs. Given that our API is currently under development and isn't actively used in production, there isn't much code to change in order to change the web framework. We are proposing to remove [Express](https://expressjs.com/) in order to utilise [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/), primarily on the basis that both frameworks can be effectively used to build APIs, but that [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) provides first-class support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Zod](https://zod.dev/) and [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) document generation out of the box. The decision to suggest [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) results from having reviewed a number of web frameworks against our team's operational context - namely [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) (as it is used elsewhere in the project), [Encore](https://encore.dev/) (because it has a good reputation for developer experience), [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) itself. Having performed a few basic spikes to test the functionality and usability of each library with [Zod](https://zod.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) document generation, both [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) and [Encore](https://encore.dev/) performed above [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/), but [Encore](https://encore.dev/) unfortunately takes too much responsibility for the resulting Docker image (no ability to edit the Dockerfile) for the service, which isn't a measure of control we're willing to give away. Using principles for library adoption established in **ADR0005**, this is how we justify the decision."},{"href":"../transitioning-bichard/","type":"Workspace Documentation","title":"Transitioning Bichard","text":"Transitioning Bichard \"Old\" Bichard Hybrid Bichard Bichard after the \"lift and shift\" into AWS.
